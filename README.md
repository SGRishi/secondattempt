# Second Attempt

This project contains a single page resume for **Rishikumar SG**.

## Purpose

The page showcases experience, skills and information about Edinburgh while demonstrating parallax and scrolling animations.

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No server is required.
3. To develop or modify the JavaScript and styles, edit `script.js` and `style.css` then refresh the browser.

A basic `npm test` script is included but currently only prints a placeholder message.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – main HTML file
- `style.css` – page styles
- `script.js` – scrolling animations
- `manifest.json` – PWA manifest

Feel free to fork and adapt for your own portfolio or resume.
